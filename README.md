# Health_manage
From local
It contains 2 files of code with simple exercise from code with harry - Health Management system
To create a program to write and retrieve content from files like diet and exercise for 3 persons 
** **It adds content like diet -- 'food eaten by a person at a particular time and date' in his diet file with date and time stamp** 

Two files are -
1) Health_management_system is main file i.e. last updated with short code 
2) health2  is just a simpler copy with (same code repeating) due to lack of few functions 
Few files made during execution on my local pc have been put under ignore , **to be ignored** 
**only health_management_system is file for use**
now trying to get it more general for any number of files
